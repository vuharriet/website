    <h3>Why I Chose Software Engineering</h3>
    <p>My passion for computers was kindled in a village where opportunities to engage with technology were scarce. Access to computers was a weekly luxury, confined to brief computer lectures, and even then, my hands-on experience was diluted, shared among six students per machine. This scarcity did little to dampen my curiosity but rather fueled a fascination with the computer’s potent capabilities—from storing vast libraries in a digital footprint to solving complex problems that would otherwise span decades.</p>
    <p>Upon my arrival in the USA, I recognized a pivotal moment to chase my aspirations. It was an opportunity to delve into the world of computing, a realm that had long captivated my imagination. I embarked on a collegiate journey with a clear objective: to deepen my understanding of this formidable human tool.</p>
    <p>I am driven by the desire to contribute to the evolution of computers, to partake in the global endeavor of harnessing technology to forge a better world. My commitment to software engineering is more than a career choice; it is a dedication to the transformative power of computers and a personal mission to be at the forefront of technological advancement.</p>
